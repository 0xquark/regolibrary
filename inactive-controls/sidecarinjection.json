    "description": "A Kubernetes Pod is a group of one or more containers with shared storage and network resources. Sidecar container is a term that is used to describe an additional container that resides alongside the main container(s). For example, service-mesh proxies are operating as sidecars in the applications\u2019 pods. Attackers can run their code and hide their activity by injecting a sidecar container into a legitimate pod, instead of running their own separated pod in the cluster, which has bigger chance of detection. This control identifies all the Pods with containers whose lifecycle is marked as sidecar (new capability) or whose names contain word sidecar.",
