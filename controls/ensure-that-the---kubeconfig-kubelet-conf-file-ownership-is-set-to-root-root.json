    "long_description": "The `kubelet.conf` file is the kubeconfig file for the node, and controls various parameters that set the behavior and identity of the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.",

For example,\n\n \n```\nchown root:root /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf\n\n```\n\n#### Impact Statement\nNone\n\n#### Default Value\nBy default, `kubelet.conf` file ownership is set to `root:root`.",

For example,\n\n \n```\nstat -c %U %G /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf\n\n```\n Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.",
