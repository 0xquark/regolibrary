    "name": "CVE-2021-25741 - Using symlink for arbitrary host file system access.",
    "attributes": {
        "armoBuiltin": true
    },
    "description": "A user may be able to create a container with subPath or subPathExpr volume mounts to access files & directories anywhere on the host filesystem. Following Kubernetes versions are affected: v1.22.0 - v1.22.1, v1.21.0 - v1.21.4, v1.20.0 - v1.20.10, version v1.19.14 and lower. This control checks the vulnerable versions and the actual usage of the subPath feature in all Pods in the cluster.",
    "remediation": "To mitigate this vulnerability without upgrading kubelet, you can disable the VolumeSubpath feature gate on kubelet and kube-apiserver, or remove any existing Pods using subPath or subPathExpr feature.",
